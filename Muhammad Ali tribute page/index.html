            <p>Born Cassius Marcellus Clay (January 17, 1942), Muhammad Ali represented a lot of things to the world in his days. He was a human-rights activist, entertainer, political ambassador, philanthropist, poet, a Muslim minister, etc. But what the world knew him best for was his boxing. In a career spanning over 20 years, Ali brought the whole world together with him inside the boxing ring and wowing them with his spectacular moves, and quick mouth.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Here is a timeline of the most defining moments in Ali's boxing career:</p>
            <div id="tribute-info-list">
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="years">1954:</span> Ali's bicycle is stolen and he tells the police officer, Joe Martin, that he wants to "whup" whoever had stolen his bike. Martin, a trainer, starts to train Clay.</li>

                    <li><span class="years">1961:</span> Clay meets the wrestler Gorgeous George from whom he learnt to trash talk.</li>
                    <li><span class="years">1964:</span> “I shook up the world” – Clay earns a fight with Sonny Liston, the then world heavy weight champion. After six greulling rounds, Liston refused to fight. Ali had won the world heavyweight title.</li>
                    <li><span class="years">1964:</span> Cassius Clay becomes Muslim and takes the name Muhammad Ali.</li>
                    <li><span class="years">1965/67:</span> Ali shows his nasty side in defence of his decision to become Muslim, first (1965) referring to Patterson (who claimed “The image of a Black Muslim as the world heavyweight champion disgraces the sport and nation.”) as “nothing but an Uncle Tom Negro and then torturing him for 12 rounds in the ring, before descending upon Ernie Terrell, in '67, for refusing to acknowledge his Muslim name and insisting on calling him Casius. Ali kept asking "What's my name" as he hammered away at Terrel.</li>
                    <li><span class="years">1966:</span> “I ain’t got no quarrel with them Vietcong”. Ali rejects the draft into the American army (which was at war with Vietnam). He would later lose his boxing titles for his stand.</li>
                    <li><span class="years">1966:</span> Ali can't find fights in America and takes the heavyweight belt out of America (for the first time since ...), first to Canada (where he beat  beat George Chuvalo), and then to England to dispose of Henry Cooper – again in a rematch – and Brian London, before hopping to Germany to beat Karl Mildenberger.</li>
                    <li><span class="years">1966:</span> The 'Ali Shuffle', a series of blurring foot moves, is unveiled in his victory over Cleveland 'Big Cat' Williams.</li>
                    <li><span class="years">1967-68:</span> Ali is stripped of his titles and banned from boxing for refusing to draft into the American army during the Vietnam war. He only just manages to avoid jail time.</li>
                    <li><span class="years">1974:</span> Ali wins back his title against George Forman in 'The Rumble in the Jungle', so called for having taken place in the African nation of Zaire (now DR Congo).</li>
                    <li><span class="years">1975:</span> Ali faces Joe Frazier in the 'Thrilla in Manilla' and wins after 14 rounds, later claiming that bout to be the closest to dying he had ever been.</li>
                    <li><span class="years">1978:</span> Ali (at age 36) becomes a three-time heavyweight champion, the first ever to achieve this feet, in a rematch against Leon Spinks.</li>
                                        <li><span class="years">1981:</span> Ali, 39, takes to the ring one more time against 27 year old  Trevor Berbick in Nassau, Bahamas in a fight dubbed 'Drama in Bahama'. The fight lasted the whole ten rounds after which a split decision gives Berbick the win. That was Ali's last ever fight as a boxer.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In 1984, Ali checked into the Columbia Presbyterian Hospital where he was diagnosed with Parkinson's Syndrome. Despite his diagnosis, Ali remained active in the public sphere, even participating as a guest referee at WrestMania (in '85). His public appearances would, however, reduce significantly as his health continued to decline with his advancing age.</p>
                <br>    
                <p>On June 2, 2016 Ali was hospitalized in Scottsdale, Arizona, with a respiratory illness, which was initially described as being mild. However, his condition worsened and Ali died the following day, June 3. He was 74.</p><br>
                                <p> He would always be remembered as <em>'the Greatest'</em>.</p>
